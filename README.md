# Prework Study Guide
## Description 

My motivation for this project was to be able to jot down different ideas and lessons learned throughout the prework.
I built this project in order to learn about HTML, CSS, Java, and the different processes that take place, while also being able to help retain that information via notes.
This solves the problem of boot camp students who have a hard time retaining information on all the different things they've learned.
